WPG 
===
WPG, WavePropaGator, is an interactive simulation framework for X-ray wavefront propagation. 

WPG provides intuitive interface to the [SRW library](https://github.com/ochubar/SRW). The [application examples](http://wpg.readthedocs.org/en/latest/tutorials.html) are  mainly oriented on [European XFEL](http://www.xfel.eu) design parameters. To learn more details, see [online documentation pages](http://wpg.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html).
