WPG 
===
WPG, WaveProperGator is an interactive simulation framework for X-ray wave  front  propagation.  
The WPG is integrated with SRW library, which provides Fourier optics approach for beam lines 
design at modern X-ray sources,   such as the 3d generation synchrotron radiation sources and 
X-ray Free Electron Lasers (XFEL). 
One can also find the application examples oriented on European XFEL (xfel.eu) design parameters.
