WPG 
===
WPG, WaveProperGator is an interactive simulation framework for X-ray wavefront propagation. 

The WPG provides intuitive interface to [SRW library](https://github.com/ochubar/SRW), 
which provides Fourier-optics based approach for beam lines 
design at modern X-ray sources,   such as the 3d generation synchrotron radiation sources and 
X-ray Free Electron Lasers (XFEL). 

The application examples oriented on [European XFEL](http://www.xfel.eu) design parameters.
